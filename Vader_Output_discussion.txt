"Server took 15 minutes to even seat me, then 10 more to even take my order. Found out they didn't even have what I wanted, 
a common accurance lately. Once I had got my drink(COLA with a shot of cherry), it was flat and tasted a little like cough 
syrup. Their first attempt at my meal, grilled cheese steak burger melt(in essence a steak burger on a grilled cheese), 
I was served just a plain grilled cheese. Once they had gotten me another sandwich, it seemed right except for the awkward 
stack of pickles in the middle, not spread out. It may seem a little nitpickey at this point, but this is by far the worst 
experience I've had at this restaurant, but not the first. I don't think I'll be returning to suffer through that again."

Dueling piano bars in Pittsburgh started at Station Square, and they died out. Then when the chain restaurant magnet \
"waterfront\" opened in 2000 the parent company of The Rock Bottom Breweries decided to open Sing Sing in back of 
The Brewery.\n\nWhen it first opened it was pretty cool. The very first house band could put on a show that led to 
standing ovations. I know, I was there. From Stairway to Heaven to Free Bird, Stayin' Alive to She's My Cherry Pie, 
Elton John to the Boss, they were amazing at sounding like the bands they were covering. Equally incredible were the 
obscure songs that audience members would shout out, songs only you though you knew, and they would effortlessly sing 
a good portion of the song, sounding like the band who's song they sung.\n\nBut today, Sing Sing seems like it's stuck 
in the early part of the 21st century. The whole dueling piano, shout out a song to stump the band, Sing us a song 
you're the piano man has run it's course. I don't hate Sing Sing, but I could never come here more than once a year. 
It's a been there, done that kind of place."
